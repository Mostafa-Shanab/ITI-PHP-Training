    <p><strong>(CNN)—</strong>

        An exoplanet the size of Jupiter has long intrigued astronomers because of its <br>scorching temperatures,
        screaming
        winds and sideways rain made of glass. Now, data <br>from the James Webb Space Telescope has revealed another
        intriguing feature of the <br>planet known as <a
            href="https://science.nasa.gov/exoplanet-catalog/hd-189733-b/">HD 189733b</u></a>: It smells like rotten
        eggs.
    </p>
    <p>Researchers studying HD 189733b’s atmosphere used Webb’s observation to spot trace <br>amounts of hydrogen
        sulfide — a
        colorless gas that releases a strong sulfuric stench and <br>has never been spotted beyond our solar system. The
        discovery
        advances what’s known <br>about the potential composition of exoplanets.</p>
    <p>
        The findings, compiled by a multi-institution team, were published Monday in the journal <br><a
            href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07760-y.epdf?sharing_token=Kc8cIno6mY9HzqhnG37bBNRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0OU44fHQnZrYUZKFO6uiE2Wx2j1BBmIc_wkLMLG0_vphkHPnQm3m0bqQ9R5DqgFcF3BPkoKcbxpEZrihy90DLFKkXSftVS3p9055gi3jHOW4iuNyFjCwPG6iGvmSB1gf0unrrgyWpTKUYXJATKDDifC-c6HzJ-d_c1AgAPLL5Szw5e0Lnpo3WQwBUx4u2g5_3Q%3D&tracking_referrer=edition.cnn.com">Nature</a>.

    <h1>An oddball planet with deadly weather</h1>
    <p>
        Scientists first discovered HD 189733b in 2005 and later identified the gas giant as a “hot <br>Jupiter” — a
        planet that has
        a similar chemical composition to Jupiter, the biggest planet <br>in our solar system, but with sizzling
        temperatures.
        Located only 64 light-years from Earth, <br>HD 189733b is the nearest hot Jupiter that astronomers can study as
        the planet
        passes in <br>front of its star. For that reason, it’s one of the most well-studied exoplanets.
    </p>
    <p>
        “HD 189733 b is not only a gas giant planet, but also a ‘giant’ in the field of exoplanets <br>because it is one
        of the
        first transiting exoplanets ever discovered,” said lead study author <br>Guangwei Fu, an astrophysicist at Johns
        Hopkins
        University, in an email. “It is the anchor <br>point for many of our understanding of exoplanet atmospheric
        chemistry and
        physics.”
